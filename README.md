# Project Overview: Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to predict customer churn for an e-commerce platform based on historical customer behavior and demographic data. By leveraging machine learning models, this project aims to identify customers who are at a higher risk of leaving the platform, allowing for targeted retention strategies. The project emphasizes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation to provide actionable insights.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of customer information, including demographic details, purchase behavior, and churn-related data. Key features include:
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, city tier, marital status, etc.
- **Behavioral Data:** Order history, payment method preferences, complaints, and feedback.
- **Churn Indicators:** Customer status (churned or not) based on the latest activity.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
To ensure the quality of the dataset, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- **Missing Value Handling:** Imputed missing values in numeric columns using mean/mode imputation and filled categorical columns based on the most frequent value.
- **Outlier Detection & Removal:** Outliers in specific columns (such as `WarehouseToHome`) were identified and removed to improve model performance.
- **Feature Transformation:** Renamed and standardized column names for better readability and consistency across the dataset.
- **Creation of Derived Features:** Additional features such as `ComplaintReceived` and `ChurnStatus` were derived from the existing dataset to capture more meaningful insights.
- **Dropping Unnecessary Columns:** Unused columns were dropped, including non-informative features such as `Complain` and `Churn`.

## Data Analysis & Insights:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover patterns in the data:
- **Churn Distribution:** The proportion of churned versus retained customers was visualized to understand the imbalance in the dataset.
- **Customer Behavior:** Analyzed the average tenure, total cashback, and other features that could be indicative of churn.
- **Segmentation:** Segmenting customers based on attributes such as payment method and preferred order category revealed significant differences in churn rates.
- **Key Features Influencing Churn:** Identified factors like city tier, marital status, and order category preference that had strong correlations with churn likelihood.

## Machine Learning Model:
The project also involves applying machine learning models to predict churn:
- **Model Selection:** Several models were evaluated, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Feature Importance:** Feature selection and importance analysis were conducted to determine which features most effectively predicted churn.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Conclusion:
This churn prediction project provides valuable insights into customer retention strategies. By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can proactively engage with them through personalized offers, customer support, and targeted campaigns. The final model, once fine-tuned, can be integrated into a live environment to predict churn in real-time and guide decision-making.

## Future Work:
- **Model Optimization:** Further hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- **Integration with Business Systems:** Deploying the model into production and automating churn prediction.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporating advanced machine learning techniques like XGBoost or Neural Networks for better accuracy.
